1. Consistent API Structure
Group all admin, vendor, and superadmin APIs under /api/admin/, /api/vendor/, /api/superadmin/ for clarity.
Use RESTful conventions: /api/quotations/:id for GET/DELETE/PUT on a single quotation.
2. Centralized Notification System
Use a global notification/toast system (e.g., react-hot-toast or notistack) for all success/error messages, instead of inline alerts.
3. Role-Based Routing and Guards
Use a higher-order component or middleware to redirect users based on their role, so vendors canâ€™t access admin/superadmin pages and vice versa.
4. Loading and Error States
Standardize loading and error states across all pages and modals.
Use a single loader component and a single error component for a consistent look.
5. Form Validation
Use a library like react-hook-form with zod for robust client-side validation and better UX.
6. API Error Handling
Show user-friendly error messages for all API failures (not just alerts).
Handle network errors and unauthorized access gracefully.
7. Pagination and Filtering
Add pagination and filtering to the quotations and orders tables for better scalability and usability.
8. User Experience
Add confirmation modals for destructive actions (delete, reject).
Add loading spinners to all buttons that trigger async actions.
After submitting a quotation, optionally redirect to the dashboard automatically after a few seconds.
9. Security
Use proper authentication (JWT or NextAuth) instead of localStorage for authenticated and userId.
Sanitize and validate all user input on the backend.
10. Code Organization
Move repeated logic (like fetching user info) into custom hooks.
Split large components/pages into smaller, reusable components.
11. Accessibility
Ensure all buttons, forms, and modals are accessible (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, focus management).
12. Mobile Responsiveness
Test and improve the UI for mobile and tablet devices.
13. Audit Trail
Optionally, add an audit log for actions like order approval, rejection, and posting.
14. Vendor Dashboard Enhancements
Let vendors see the status of their quotations (pending/approved/rejected).
Add a history of orders they have quoted on.
15. Admin/Superadmin Features
Allow admins to edit or cancel orders before they are posted.
Allow superadmins to export data (CSV, Excel) for reporting.
